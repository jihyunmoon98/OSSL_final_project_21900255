## What does this project do?

  This is solar power prediction project.
  
  With Raspberry Pi and jupyter notebook in operation, this project can be used.
  
  ### Information about each files
  
  weather_forecast.ipynb file: how to forecast the weather by using the Korea Meteorological Administration. 
  
  solar_power_predict.ipynb file: how to predict the solar power with the weater data
  
  weather_forecast.csv: the result of weather_forecast.ipynb program
  
  조회서비스_오픈API활용가이드_격자_위경도(20210401).excel: predictable area information provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration
  
## Why is this project useful?

  According to the news, solar power uses unlimited and pollution-free solar enery, so it is highly characterized by unnecessary fuel costs and no air pollution and waste generation. It is also easier to maintain than other facilities, and is very economical because it can operate for a long time with a solar cell life of at least 20 years.
  Moving forward, solar power will be used many people. Therefore, it would be helpful to predict solar power so that people can preview the energy they can use.
  

## How do I get started?

  Install the jupyter notebook on the raspberry pi for the first time.
  Get a service key from Korea Meteorological Adminstration site.
    ->If you want to forecast other city, download the 조회서비스_오픈API활용가이드_격자_위경도(20210401).excel file
  Install other necessary library to predict weather and solar power.
